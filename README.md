This app looks at some good practices in design and implementation 
of an Android app. 

- Modules to implement Clean Architecture (Data, Domain, Presentation etc.).
- Coroutines/Flows to perform asynchronous tasks.
- Communication between modules via interface (Dependency Inversion).
- Perform task after coroutine execution is complete.
- ViewModel as the glue between UI and Domain layer.
- UI Components defined in ui module, which are used by app module.
- MutableStateFlow instance in ViewModel to update UI state.
- Using Sealed class instead of Enums to define UiState.

In general, this is my Golden Sample app. When it comes to 
Good Android/Kotlin code and practices.
